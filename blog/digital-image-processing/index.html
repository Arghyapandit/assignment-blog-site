      <h1 class="main-heading">Digital image processing</h1>
      <p>
        In computer science, digital image processing is the use of computer
        algorithms to perform image processing on digital images. As a
        subcategory or field of digital signal processing, digital image
        processing has many advantages over analog image processing. It allows a
        much wider range of algorithms to be applied to the input data and can
        avoid problems such as the build-up of noise and signal distortion
        during processing. Since images are defined over two dimensions (perhaps
        more) digital image processing may be modeled in the form of
        multidimensional systems.

      <h2>History</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>
        Many of the techniques of digital image processing, or digital picture
        processing as it often was called, were developed in the 1960s at the
        Jet Propulsion Laboratory, Massachusetts Institute of Technology, Bell
        Laboratories, University of Maryland, and a few other research
        facilities, with application to satellite imagery, wire-photo standards
        conversion, medical imaging, videophone, character recognition, and
        photograph enhancement. The cost of processing was fairly high, however,
        with the computing equipment of that era.
      </p>
      <img src="../../image/02.jpg" alt="" />
      <p>
        That changed in the 1970s, when digital image processing proliferated as
        cheaper computers and dedicated hardware became available. Images then
        could be processed in real time, for some dedicated problems such as
        television standards conversion. As general-purpose computers became
        faster, they started to take over the role of dedicated hardware for all
        but the most specialized and computer-intensive operations. With the
        fast computers and signal processors available in the 2000s, digital
        image processing has become the most common form of image processing and
        generally, is used because it is not only the most versatile method, but
        also the cheapest.

      <p>
        Digital image processing technology for medical applications was
        inducted into the Space Foundation Space Technology Hall of Fame in
        1994.
